//Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
//Example 10 program 1.
//My name is Naila.
//24 April.
//This program will be Multiply.
console.log(6 * 4);
//Example 10 program 2.
//My name is Naila.
//24 April.
//Thie program will be show code.
console.log("Fozia is my best friend.");
