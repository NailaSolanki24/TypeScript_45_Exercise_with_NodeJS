//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.

function show_magicians(Magicians: string[]) {
  Magicians.forEach((name) => console.log(name));
}

function make_great(Magicians: string[]) {
  return Magicians.map((name) => ` The Great ${name}`);
}

let magicians_names = ["Harry Poter", "Derren Brown", "Shin Lim"];

let great_magician = make_great(magicians_names);

show_magicians(great_magician);
